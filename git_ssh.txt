# it has to be:
origin	git@github.com:tnakajo42/get_next_line.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:tnakajo42/get_next_line.git (push)

# if not, you have to change:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:tnakajo42/get_next_line.git

# clone your repository with ssh link "to set the new ssh key on your system"
git clone git@github.com:tnakajo42/get_next_line.git
--> yes (for the question: Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?)
# you can push in vs code
